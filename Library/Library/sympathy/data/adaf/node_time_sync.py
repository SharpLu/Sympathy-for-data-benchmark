With the :ref:`ADAF` format it is possible to store data from an experiment
that has been simultaneously measured by different measurement systems. This
possibility raises the oppportunity to perform cross analysis between
quantities gathered by the different systems. Common sitaution, and problem,
is that there may not exist a mutual absolute zero time between the systems.
A time synchronization may therefore be a necessity in order to have correlated
timebases which is required for cross analysis.

The synchronization process requires that two systems are specified, where one
of them is defined to be the reference system. An offset between the systems
will be calculated by using one of the following methods:

- OptimizationLSF
- Interpolate
- Shared event (positive)
- Shared event (negative)
- Sync parts

This offset is then used to shift the timebases in the non-reference ("syncee")
system. To obtain the offset it is important that there is a synchronization
signal in both of the systems. The signals should be of the same quantity and
have the same unit.

*Shared event*
  When using any of the shared event strategies a specified threshold in the
  synchronization signal determines the shared event that is used to calculate
  the offset with the above mentioned methods. *Positive* or *negative* in the
  name of the strategy refers to what value the derivative of the signal should
  have. Positive means that the signal should rise above the threshold to
  qualify as a shared event, whereas negative means that the signal should drop
  below the threshold.

*OptimizationLSF*
  This strategy starts off with a shared event (positive) strategy for finding
  a starting guess. After that it chooses 500 randomly distributed points and
  does a least square fit of the two signals evaluated in those randomly
  distributed points. This means that minor random variations can occur when
  using this strategy.

*Interpolate*
  This strategy also starts with a shared event strategy, but then interpolates
  both signals linearly to find a subsample timing.

*Sync parts*
  If you want to do many-to-one syncronization you should use *Sync parts*. The
  system with one long meassurement should be chosen as reference system. The
  other system can have many shorter parts which should be vjoined beforehand
  (:ref:`VJoin ADAFs`). Choose the Vjoin index signal in the VJoin signal drop
  down. As a first step this strategy tries to find a good place to put the
  first part. This is done by finding all the places where the mean value of
  the first parts is passed in the reference signal. All these places are tried
  in order and the best match (in a least squares sense) is chosen as the
  starting point for the first part. All other parts are then moved the same
  distance so that they keep their offsets between each other. As a last step
  all parts are individually optimized using the same least square optimization
  as in the *OptimizationLSF* strategy.
